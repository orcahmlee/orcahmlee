### Hi there, I am Andrew.

I am currently working as a Data Engineer and Data Analyst, besides I am a cross-domain engineer.:smile:<br>

I had experienced in various domains, such as genetic engineering, metabolic engineering, fermentation engineering, filament spinning engineering, solvent recycling engineering, composite materials engineering, and full-stack development. 

Base on the above experiences, I am good at communicating with people who work in different fields. Because of my experience in multiple domains and I am always thinking out of the box, I could provide some fresh ideas for a new project or solutions during brainstorming.

The above experiences do not seem to be related, but they truly connect each other by **DATA**.<br>
